# UrChaperone

![](https://github.com/AcroMace/UrChaperone/raw/master/Screenshots/push.jpg)

UrChaperone detects when you leave your house and sends you a push notification. You can swipe on the push notification to call an Uber home.

Created for Hack the North 2016.

## Future features

- *Curfew*: Only send notifications when you are outside the house at night (ex. 10 PM - 7 AM)
- *Custom home location*: The user should be able to enter an address to set a home location instead of just taking current location and being able to save it. We could also use Uber's API to fetch the home address.
- *Activate/deactivate*: Allow the user to turn off the monitoring for a while
- *Smarter background activity*: Reduce background location and local notifications updates to improve battery lilfe while using the app
